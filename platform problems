I have been setting up new cell phone and getting everything connected properly between devices and different platforms. I am still new to using github for flow control and documentation processes.
Hopefully I am commenting properly so that future self will be able to see a clear progression. Using library computer to get dailyt wifi signal and check emails. Still looking at code to learn.
C++, java, html, are main languages that I am working with. Android studio, visual basic, and windows environments maily where I am working with now. 
The guitar is a personal app that I want to use./ The app will allow me to use cell phone as a midi controller that can output signals for recording or live play.
I also need to learn about transformers and neural networks so that I can build better applications.
